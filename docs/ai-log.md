# AI log

Every time you give an AI tool a significant prompt, add an entry. Three lines each.
"Nothing was wrong" is allowed, but it is rarely true. Your instructor will read this.

## Build 2

### Prompt 1: Build 2 prompt (docs/build-2.md)
- **What I asked:** Add `mergeSort` (stable, non-mutating, no `Array.prototype.sort`), `publishEvent`/`listEventSummaries` in inventory.js, a pure `eventSearch.js` with `filterEvents`, `sortEvents` and `searchEvents`, tests with `node:test` for S02, S03, S04-publish, S05 and S06, and an `npm test` script.
- **What came back:** `src/domain/sorting.js`, additions to `src/domain/inventory.js`, `src/domain/eventSearch.js`, `test/build2.test.js`, and a `"test": "node --test"` script. All 14 tests pass and the demo runs.
- **What was wrong (or "nothing"):** Two small things. (1) The first `getHeaders`/price code ignored the "events with no tiers are left out of price filters" rule until I made `maxPriceCents` require a non-null cheapest price. (2) The S04 test used a top-level `await import(...)` inside a non-async test, which threw a syntax error; I import `unpublishEvent` at the top instead.

### Prompt 2: "Make it readable and add a demo"
- **What I asked:** Clean up the merge sort (drop an unused `aux` array), rewrite the search module in the project's comment style, and add `scripts/demo-search.js` wired to `npm run demo:search`.
- **What came back:** A recursive `mergeSort` with a small `merge` helper, a commented `eventSearch.js`, and a demo that seeds three events and prints each filter/sort.
- **What was wrong (or "nothing"):** Nothing broken, but the first demo used `capacity: 0`, which `addTier` rejects (capacity must be at least 1); I seed 1 seat and book it to show a sold-out event instead.
